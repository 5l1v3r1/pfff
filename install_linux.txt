Install pcre-devel, gtk2-devel, atk-devel, pango-devel, and cairo-devel,
swi-prolog.

For instance:
for redhat: sudo yum install pcre-devel
for ubuntu: sudo apt-get install pcre-devel
for gentoo: sudo emerge pcre
for arch: I don't remember

then
  $ ./configure
  $ make depend
  $ make
  $ make opt

For Ubuntu/Debian you want to install libpcre3-dev,
libgtk2.0-dev, libcairo2-dev and libpango1.0-dev. These are the
correct package names (pcre-devel does not exist, and so on).

On Fedora you may need to install the camlp4 packages too: 
 ocaml-camlp4 ocaml-camlp4-devel
