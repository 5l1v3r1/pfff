* dangling else

See http://plus.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/ocamllex-ocamlyacc/ocamlyacc-tutorial/sec-context-dependent-precedence.html

The rules are essentially:

stmt: if e then stmt else stmt (R1)
    | if e then stmt           (R2)

When we have 'if then if then else' we want to group that
as 'if then (if then else)' and not 'if then (if then) else'
so we want that once we have seen 'if then if then' and
that we are looking at a 'else' to shift and not reduce.

So we want the priority of the reduce rule R2 to be lower
than the priority of shifting in R1 hence the %prec LOW_PRIORITY_RULE
directive next to R2.

Note that if you force people to use { } for if and else, as in Hack, then
you don't have any conflic issues as you will either write

 if e then { if then { } else { } } 
or
 if e then { if then { } } else { }

to indicate what you want.

* xhp

'<' is overloaded in PHP. Can be the start of an xhp element
or comparison.

':' is also overloaded.

* attributes

One of the rule concerning attributes is:

function_declaration_statement:
 |            unticked_function_declaration_statement { $1 }
 | attributes unticked_function_declaration_statement { $2 }

but we can not factorize by using a attributes_opt as in:

function_declaration_statement: attributes_opt unticked...

attributes_opt:
 | /* empty */ (R1)
 | attributes  (R2)                

Indeed reading from the start a T_FUNCTION, one can not decide between the
start of the definition of a function, hence reducing an hypotetical
empty attributes_opt rule R1, or shifting to a state
allowing both the definition of a function or the start
of a closure statement.

So as a classic trick we have to "unfold/inline" attributes_opt
and duplicate rules to avoid early reduce and keep shifting.

* types

In the same way for
constant_declaration_statement:
 | T_CONST               T_IDENT TEQ static_scalar TSEMICOLON
     { ($1, Name $2, $3, $4, $5) }
 | T_CONST ext_type_hint T_IDENT TEQ static_scalar TSEMICOLON
     { ($1, Name $3, $4, $5, $6) (* todo: use $2 *) }

we can not factorize with a ext_type_hint_opt because seing an IDENT,
one does not know if it should reduce ext_type_hint because it's
the ident of a type or shift because maybe it's the ident of the const.

* foo()[] xhp sugar

    * This extension fix a deficiency in the original PHP grammar
    * which does not allow to do things like foo()[2]. Array accesses
    * in PHP were allowed only for variables.
    *
    * I thought I could remove some conflicts by putting the rule
    * closer to the funcall_call rule, which does not
    * generate any conflict, but it then can not handle
    * code like $o->foo()['foo'].
    *
    * I then thought I could put it closer to variable2,
    * but it must be 'variable' not 'variable2' otherwise
    * it can not process code like foo()['fld1']['fld2'].
    *
    * In fact it can not be put close to 'variable' either because
    * then it can not parse code like ($this->getAssocData($user))[0];
    * So the right place is here, in expr_without_variable?
    *
    * But then it can not parse code like isset(foo()[0]) because
    * isset accept only variable(lvalue).
    *

* variable declaration (not used anymore)

/*
(* less: this is commented because it is not really used and it generates
 * some conflicts now that type_hint is not anymore
 *   type_hint: ident { ... } but
 *   type_hint: class_name_or_selfparent { ... }
 *
 * | type_hint variable TSEMICOLON          { ... }
 * | type_hint variable TEQ expr TSEMICOLON { ... }
 * Right now the only places where we allow types are for parameters
 * and globals/constants. The rest is inferred.
