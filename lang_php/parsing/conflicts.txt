* dangling else

See http://plus.kaist.ac.kr/~shoh/ocaml/ocamllex-ocamlyacc/ocamlyacc-tutorial/sec-context-dependent-precedence.html

The rules are essentially:

stmt: if e then stmt else stmt (R1)
    | if e then stmt           (R2)

When we have 'if then if then else' we want to group that
as 'if then (if then else)' and not 'if then (if then) else'
so we want that once we have seen 'if then if then' and
that we are looking at a 'else' to shift and not reduce.

So we want the priority of the reduce rule R2 to be lower
than the priority of shifting in R1 hence the %prec LOW_PRIORITY_RULE
directive next to R2.
