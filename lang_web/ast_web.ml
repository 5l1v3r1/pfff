(*
 * This file contains the type definitions for a full web document, that is
 * HTML + JS(script) + CSS(style)
 * 
 * The difference with other HTML parsers like html5lib is that this one
 * understands JS and CSS too and the possible HTML strings inside
 * the JS code and so on; it's a recursive parser.
