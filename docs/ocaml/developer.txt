have C-c C-t working to get type information under cursor

** style: 

*** bad example of style: ocamlnet/netstring/nethtml.ml.

 bad nested functions,
 bad indentation, too many newlines
 bad use of open variants
 overuse of intermediate functions like extract

old: nested func
  let model_of element_name =
    if element_name = "" then
      (`Everywhere, `Any)
    else
      let extract =
	function
	    (eclass, `Sub_exclusions(_,m)) -> eclass, m
	  | m -> m
      in
      try
	extract(Hashtbl.find dtd_hash element_name)
      with
	  Not_found -> (`Everywhere, `Any)
  in

better:
let model_of ~dtd_hash element_name =
  if element_name = "" 
  then (Everywhere, Any)
  else
    try 
      (match Hashtbl.find dtd_hash element_name with 
      | (eclass, Sub_exclusions(_,m)) -> eclass, m
      | m -> m
      )
    with Not_found -> (Everywhere, Any)

*** bad example of style: ccss/
bad use of open variants instead of plan variants
use of _t to suffix type definition (no need, different namespace)
unindented mutually recursive types. When have lots of type definitions,
 as it's the case usually with AST of languages, indent the types
 to convey grouping information.
