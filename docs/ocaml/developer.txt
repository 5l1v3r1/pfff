have C-c C-t working to get type information under cursor


style:
 bad example of style: ocamlnet/netstring/nethtml.ml.
 bad nested functions,
 bad indentation, too many newlines
 bad use of open variants
 overuse of intermediate functions like extract

old: nested func
  let model_of element_name =
    if element_name = "" then
      (`Everywhere, `Any)
    else
      let extract =
	function
	    (eclass, `Sub_exclusions(_,m)) -> eclass, m
	  | m -> m
      in
      try
	extract(Hashtbl.find dtd_hash element_name)
      with
	  Not_found -> (`Everywhere, `Any)
  in

better:
let model_of ~dtd_hash element_name =
  if element_name = "" 
  then (Everywhere, Any)
  else
    try 
      (match Hashtbl.find dtd_hash element_name with 
      | (eclass, Sub_exclusions(_,m)) -> eclass, m
      | m -> m
      )
    with Not_found -> (Everywhere, Any)
