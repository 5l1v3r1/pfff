This directory comes from the svn repo of thrift at
svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/thrift/trunk thrift
in directory lib/ocaml

I have modified the Makefile, added some .mli, and some debugging
information.
I have also extended the server interface to accept socket options
(such as SO_REUSEADDR).

added -bin-annot.
