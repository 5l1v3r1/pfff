core:

ocamlcairo: used by codemap/codegraph, core graphics library.
ocamlgtk:   used by codemap/codegraph, mostly for interactive menus and basic
 UI chrome.

ocamlgraph: used by commons/graph.ml and so graph_code, also a bit by 
 lang_html/? TODO why dependencies to codegraph is now shown in cg?

ocamlzip: used by externals/javalib (used itself by lang_bytecode/)
extlib: used by externals/javalib (used itself by lang_bytecode/)

ocamlbdb: used by lang_php/analyze but could be removed, I now prefer prolog db
ocamlmpi: not used, quite fragile in general and I now prefer to use cores
ocamlthrift: used by facebook/, could be removed, quite fragile too
ocamlnet: used by lang_html/, but mostly to double check, could be removed
ocamlpcre: used by lang_php/ but could be replaced by just Str
phylomel: used a bit by codegraph but could be removed, I prefer graphviz or cg
