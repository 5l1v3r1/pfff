Install macports http://www.macports.org/

Then
 $ sudo port install pcre
 => can ./configure -bdb

 $ sudo port install cairo
 $ sudo port install gtk
 => can configure -visual

 $ sudo port install mysql
 => can ./configure -facebook

For cairo and gtk don't use the quartz setting as it is currently
buggy under macports.
