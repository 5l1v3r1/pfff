port install pcre
 => can ./configure -bdb

port install cairo; port install gtk
 => can configure -visual

port install mysql
 => can ./configure -facebook

for cairo + gtk don't use the quartz setting. Here are a few problems:
 - problem with current tk package in macports, had to patch it.
 - problem with flags. Had to use +no_x11 in addition to +quartz.
   Try install first cairo (with the 2 flags), then pango, then
   gtk2
 - get segfault on text_extent, probably because of pbs with pango ...
=> have to use cairo + gtk + x11 for now
