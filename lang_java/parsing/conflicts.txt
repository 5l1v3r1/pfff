* When add generics

We can have expressions like:
 i<b;
and type declarations like
 i<b> x;

hence an ambiguity which requires some lookahead or semantic information
to know what is 'i' (is it a type name?).

solutions?
 - use a GLR parser
 - c/c++ parser trick to tag differently <
 - parser trick to tag differently typedef and idents
