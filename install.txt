You must first install a recent version of 
 - OCaml (at least 3.11), 
   see http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
 - Berkeley DB (at least 4.3)
   if you want the analysis capability
 - GTK (at least gtk 2.10)
   if you want the GUI capabilities.
 - Cairo
   if you want the fancy graphics capabilities.
 - Pcre
   if you want stuff I don't remember.

OCaml may be available already on your Linux/Mac/Windows distributions.
You can also try to do:
 
  $ source env.sh 

which setup the PATH and other variables to places where OCaml may
already be.

If you just want to compile the parsing frontend, then type 

   $ ./configure


If you want the parsing frontend and the analysis framework then type

  $ ./configure --bdb

You will also need the runtime and development library for berkley db 4.3.


If you want everything then just type

  $ ./configure --with-all

You will also need the runtime and development library for gtk2 and cairo.



Then type:

  $ make depend
  $ make
  $ make install
