You must first install a recent version of 
 - OCaml (at least 3.11), 
   see http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
 - Pcre
   if you want stuff I don't remember.
 - GTK (at least gtk 2.10) and Cairo
   if you want codemap, the fancy graphics code visualizer.
 - Berkeley DB (at least 4.3)
   if you need to process huge codebase
 - SWI-prolog
   if you want the interactive code query tool

You will need both the runtime and the development library for
those packages (e.g. pcre and pcre-devel packages under most Linux
distributions).

If you want most of the good things just type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make depend
  $ make
  $ make opt

This should generate a few binaries at the toplevel directory such
as pfff or codemap.


If you just want to compile the parsing frontend, then type 

   $ ./configure -nogui -novisual -nobdb

If you want the parsing frontend and the analysis framework then type

  $ ./configure -nogui -novisual
